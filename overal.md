# TrashBot: Marine Trash Picker Robot  

**TrashBot** is an innovative robotic system designed to detect, collect, and categorize trash in water bodies such as oceans, rivers, and lakes. The robot uses computer vision for detecting various types of pollutants and ensures minimal interference with the surrounding marine environment.  

This project is aimed at combating water pollution by creating an autonomous or semi-autonomous system that collects trash efficiently while preserving aquatic ecosystems.

## Features  
- **Computer Vision-Powered Detection**  
  - Uses YOLO-based object detection to identify and categorize trash into types such as plastic, metal, glass, and natural debris.  

- **Trash Collection Mechanism**  
  - Employs a floating robotic platform equipped with arms or conveyor systems to pick up detected trash.  

- **Environmental Sensitivity**  
  - Designed to minimize disturbance to marine life and ecosystems.  

- **Scalability**  
  - Currently a floating robot with future plans for a submersible version for underwater trash detection and collection.

- **Control System:**  
  - Microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi for motor control and sensor integration.  

### **2. Software Components**  
#### **a. Computer Vision**  
- YOLO model to detect trash categories in real-time.  
- Training data includes pollutants like:  
  - Plastics (bottles, bags, etc.)  
  - Glass (bottles, shards)  
  - Metal (cans, debris)  
  - Paper/Cardboard  
  - Organic waste  
  - Miscellaneous trash  

#### **b. Control Algorithms**  
- Path planning for trash collection.  
- Obstacle avoidance to prevent collisions with boats or marine life.  

#### **c. Data Logging**  
- Logs the type and quantity of trash collected for further analysis.  
- Data is stored in a database for use in environmental reports or studies.
